# Project TODO Example
While your team may have another way to track TODO items, a Markdown document in CoCalc works just fine. Here's how you would create it. If you have a list of **commitments**, **upcoming tasks** and completed tasks, you can move tasks from *Upcoming* to *Commitments* when they are assigned, and then from *Commitments* to the *Completed Tasks* section when they're done.

If you edit the TODO list in CoCalc, everyone will be able to update it in real-time as needed.

## Commitments
### Person A
* (by April 15th) Fix bug (describe bug)
* Read and summarize the following articles:
  * Article A (link)
  * Article B (link)

### Person B
* (by April 10th) Organize meetings for the week
* Update the lab notebook after the next meeting

## Upcoming Tasks Without a Person Assigned
* (by April 20th) Add images to the TODO list template
* Copy-edit the TODO list template for spling errors

## Completed Tasks

### Person A
* ~~create TODO list example template~~

### Person B
* ~~offer feedback on the TODO list example~~
