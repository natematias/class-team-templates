# [Team Project] Lab Notebook
*Spring 2020*

**Project description**: A lab notebook document is an internal agreed-on record of key decisions and events in the arc of your team's project. The audience for a lab notebook is the team behind the project, though you might sometimes share your notebook with others such as an instructor. While you will want to keep your task lists elsewhere, the lab notebook is also a good place to store other agreements, such as what role each team member will play. 

## Project Roles
* **Person** is responsible for X and Y
* **Person** is responsible for Z and Q

## Key Documents for this project
Your lab notebook is also a great place to store the key documents for your project.

## Project Decisions and Updates
These should be recorded in reverse chronological order so you can see the most recent first. Think about these updates as information that allows you or someone else to reconstruct what happened over the course of the project and why you made various decisions. You shouldn't have a reason to go back and edit entries after creating them- just add a new one! Here's an example entry:

#### 04.01.2020 - Created Lab Notebook (example entry)
Today we created the lab notebook. We decided that it should include:
* A project description
* Project roles
* Links to key documents
* Project Decisions and Updates

We could have included task lists / TODOs in the lab notebook, but we decided against it.
